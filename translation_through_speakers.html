          <p>Translation Through Speakers was Jon Bellion’s 2nd mixtape but his first, Scattered Thoughts Vol. 1, is hard to find on streaming 
            platforms and in general. This mixtape was completely written, produced, and recorded by Bellion.  It has a childlike, youthful 
            charm to it that makes it feel warm, pleasant, and fun. Some critiques of the album are that some of the lyrics and songs feel corny 
            and cringy compared to his later projects. These songs show just how far Bellion’s lyrics and style has evolved since he first started 
            releasing music. It is hard to find any information about this mixtape and the inspiration behind it because at this time Bellion was 
            still primarily working as a song writer and hadn’t gained much popularity.</p>
