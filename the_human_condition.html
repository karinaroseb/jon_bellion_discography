          <p>The Human Condition is Jon Bellion’s first studio album released through Capital Records June of 2016. The album debuted at #1 on iTunes 
            and peaked at 5 on the Billboard 200. In an interview Jon defined Human condition as the state or condition of being human, especially 
            regarded as being inherently problematic or flawed. He also said “I wanted to give audiences something that looks like what’s going on in 
            my head when I’m making music, these colors and pictures, because that’s how I see music. I can’t read music, but I see colors. In my head, 
            there’s a Pixar movie going on all the time.” A lot of people don’t realize it but this album was in a way a proposal to Pixar, in the back 
            of the cd booklet Bellion writes about how he one day dreams of scoring a Pixar film. Bellion worked with artist David Ardinaryas Lojaya for 
            the cover and corresponding artworks for each song. All the pieces include characters and a connecting storyline. The album cover alone took 
            4 months to finish. Click below to view all the individual artworks.</p>
