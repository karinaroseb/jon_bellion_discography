          <p>Glory Sound Prep is Jon’s sophomore album, released on November 9th, 2018. Before the announcement, the album was cryptically referred to
             as GSP for months, showing up in various Instagram stories, Twitter, etc. It was announced on October 10, 2018 with an animated video 
             featuring Stormzy, revealing it as an academy of sorts. Every song on this album is accompanied with  a short animated motion picture. 
             Bellion has mentioned many times about his dislike of social media and the stress that the industry puts on musicians. For GSP Bellion 
             only did two interviews talking about the album. He said “ People were like ‘I want to hear him talk about it,' but the art is for you to 
             digest and for you to listen to and really take in. That was the entire concept.” He also talked about his creative process like this 
             “I have to wait for messages, I have to wait for something to speak; I'm not just going to say something to garner attention. I'd rather 
             feed ten people than entertain 1,000. So if I'm really trying to feed somebody and give it to them, it's going to take time, and whoever 
             comes to me through that, I'll be way happier as an artist for it.”</p> 
             <p>There are many easter eggs and messages hidden throughout Glory Sound 
             Prep, like Dragon Ball Z voice actor Chris Sabat narrates the multi-part track, “Adult Swim. In “Mah’s Joint,” he talks about his fear of 
             having dementia like his grandmother when he grows old and is also a tribute to his mother for caring for his grandmother with humility and
            grace. These are things that are only picked up on from listing to the album multiple times and really taking it in. Click below to see the 
            short animation for the songs and the album trailer.</p>
