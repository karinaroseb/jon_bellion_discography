          <p>The Definition was Jon Bellion’s last mixtape that he released, it came out on September 23rd 2014. 
            Shortly after this mixtape was released Bellion went on his first national tour Beautiful Minds tour which was sold out.
             Bellion was gaining popularity both as a song writer and as a musician. In one interview he said “The Definition is me imaging is 
             J-Dilla made a Pixar movie. That’s how I wanted this album to sound. Imagine The Incredibles or Finding Nemo with those lovable, 
             colorful lush musical landscapes over J-Dilla hip-hop beats. That’s my sound.” This mixtape really shows Bellion’s sound and developed 
             style. All three mixtapes were later re-released together in a box set called Growth after Bellion was signed to Capital Records.</p>
